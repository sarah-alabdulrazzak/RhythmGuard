
Reduced Dataset from UCI was used as is. 
Extracted parameters: PTT, HR, SBP, DBP.
All the 12,000 instants were processed over a window of 5 seconds at a time. 
The values of the extracted parameters were averaged over that window. 
The attached version of the Jupyter Notebook "Reduced_DataSet_v0.7" is good up to the generation of that data, the machine learning part comes later.
